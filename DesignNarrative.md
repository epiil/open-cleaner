##Summary

Opencleaner consists of a dual-motor spindle drivetrain that moves videotape through two Pellon cleaning stations by way of a supply and takeup reel, controlled by an Arduino Uno microcontroller and integrated motor shield. The tape's speed and tension are monitored by an array of IR sensors, photointerrupters and potentiometers that provide feedback to the microcontroller for motor speed control. Each Pellon cleaning station uses individual drivetrains that incrementally advance fabric past several contact points.
