###Parts List (Updated 8/2/2015)

Note: This parts list is a work-in-progress, and will be revised as parts are continuously tested. Please see /partslist/OpenCleanerPartsList.csv for associated parts vendors and prices. 

There are a number of essential Opencleaner parts that currently aren't included on this list. They include:

- (2) Motor Spindles. Currently these spindles are harvested from defunct 1/4" and 1/2" VTR machines. Since this is not a sustainable solution, more research is needed to machine/print modular spindles. 
- (4) Stainless Steel Anti-Static Precision Rollers. The prototype Opencleaner currenly uses 3D-printed PLA precision rollers for testing purposes, with the associated printing schematics (.STL, .SCAD, etc.) included in this repo. However, these rollers need to be machined in anti-static stainless steel using a professsional vendor. 
- (1) Tension roller assembly: The prototype currently employs a 1) NSK LE12-1 Linear Slide Bearing Block w/Rail 60mm x 24mm x 8.5mm, with travel matching the length of the Bourns linear potentiometer, and 2) mounting hardware for the associated precision roller. When moving Opencleaner out of prototype, the tension roller design will ultimately change to a preferred chassis (top) mounted device.
