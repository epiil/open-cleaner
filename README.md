##open-cleaner: An (in-progress) open-source tape cleaning solution for analog video / magnetic media

##Repository Contents:

- /hardware - contains .scad, .dxf and .stl files for parts fabrication. All 2D/3D modeling is done with OpenSCAD (http://www.openscad.org/). All circuit schematics are done with Fritzing (http://fritzing.org/home/)

- /software - contains .ino Arduino "sketches" and Arduino libraries (http://www.arduino.cc/)

- /misc - contains cleaning parameters, parts lists, photos, schematics, etc. 

###Parameters:

- Capstan-less dual-motor spindle drivetrain

- Leader sensing system 

- Automatically stop and reverse when tape is nearing end

- Tape speed and tension monitoring (approximately 120 ips on average). Tension sensor arm measures tape tension.

- Two cleaning stations at center with automatic advance, forward, rewind

- Adjustable spindle flanges based on format
